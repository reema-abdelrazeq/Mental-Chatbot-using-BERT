# Response Prediction Model ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬
A chatbot-like model built using BERT to classify user inputs into various intents and provide contextually relevant responses. This project demonstrates an interactive response system based on user messages, handling intents like greetings, emotions, and advice.

# Features ðŸŒŸ
BERT-based model: Leverages BERT for text classification.
Interactive Chat: Predicts intents and provides responses.
User-friendly: Simple and intuitive conversational flow.

# Getting Started ðŸš€
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/reema_abdelrazeq/Mental-Chatbot-using-BERT.git
2. Install Dependencies :pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the model :python chatbot.py

# Dataset ðŸ“Š
The dataset used for training the model consists of labeled user inputs categorized into different intents. The dataset can be found on Kaggle:

You can explore and download the dataset from there for more details.

# Model Details ðŸ§ 
1. Architecture: The model is based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a transformer-based deep learning model known for its superior performance in text classification tasks.
2. Training: The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of labeled user input, where each input is associated with an intent, such as greetings, emotional states (sadness, happiness), requests for advice, and farewells.
3. Response Generation: For each predicted intent, the model maps it to pre-defined, contextually relevant responses, offering a smooth and conversational experience.
4. Classification: The model classifies user messages into categories such as:
Greeting ðŸ‘‹
Sadness ðŸ˜¢
User advice ðŸ’¡
Goodbye ðŸ‘‹
